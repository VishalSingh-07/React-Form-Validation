# React Form Validation using Formik and Yup

This repository contains an example of how to perform form validation in a React application using Formik and Yup. Formik is a popular library that helps manage form state and validation in React applications, while Yup is a powerful schema validation library that works seamlessly with Formik to define validation rules.

## How it Works

In this project, we have implemented a simple form with form validation using Formik and Yup. The form includes various fields that need to be validated before submission. The validation rules are defined using the Yup schema.

- The Formik library is used to handle the form state, form submission, and form validation.
- Yup is used to define the validation schema and perform validation on the form fields.

The form's UI and components are kept minimal to focus on the form validation process. When a user interacts with the form, Formik and Yup automatically validate the input fields according to the specified validation rules.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies used in this project are:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Formik: A library to manage form state and validation in React applications.
- Yup: A library to define validation schemas and perform form validation.
